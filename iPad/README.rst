Another option to explore is an iPad version with Pythonista. 
Pythonista ships with objc_util which is a bridge between
Objective C and Python.  The code is here:
https://github.com/omz/PythonistaAppTemplate/blob/0961e64a9e524fd785b4b4813e9c61d713d34b2e/PythonistaAppTemplate/PythonistaKit.framework/pylib/site-packages/objc_util.py

which is part of the Pythonista App Template on GitHub:
https://github.com/omz/PythonistaAppTemplate

An example script of objc_util is here:

The other option is Rubicon-Objc:
https://github.com/pybee/rubicon-objc

It is open source and works with either MacOs or iOS but it is part of
the BeeWare project so it might not be easy to get it working.
